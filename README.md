# Task Management System

### Overview

The Task Management System is a robust application designed to streamline task management processes for both administrators and employees. Built using PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP, this system offers a comprehensive suite of features that facilitate efficient task allocation, progress tracking, and communication within an organization.

### Detailed Description

The Task Management System is engineered to enhance productivity by providing a centralized platform for managing tasks. It allows administrators to assign roles, create and delegate tasks, and monitor the progress of each task in real-time. Employees can view their assigned tasks, update their status, and receive notifications about important updates or deadlines.

The system's architecture is built on a secure foundation, ensuring that all user data is protected through robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. The role-based access control ensures that users have access only to the information pertinent to their responsibilities.
